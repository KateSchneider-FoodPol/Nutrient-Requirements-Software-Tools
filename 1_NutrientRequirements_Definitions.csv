Acronym,Full Name,Definition
DRI,Dietary Reference Intakes,The DRIs comprise all the subsequent nutrient requirement categories.
EAR,Estimated Average Requirement,"The average daily nutrient intact level estimated to meet the requirements of half of the individuals in the population. Establishing the EAR requires sufficient scientific evidence. It is a tool for assessing and planning the intake of populations and groups, not individuals."
EER,Estimated Energy Requirement,"The EER is the EAR for energy. It is the average dietary energy intake that is predicted to maintain energy balance in a healthy individual (specific to age, sex, weight, height, and physical activity level, as well as life stage for children and pregnant/lactating women) consistent with good health. The active level of physical activity is recommended for healthy individuals to maintain and promote long-term health."
RDA,Recommended Dietary Allowance,The average dietary nutrient intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all health individuals in the population. It is two standard deviations above the EAR.
AI,Adequate Intake,The recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined approximations or estimates of nutrient intake that are assumed to be adequate and is expected to meet the needs of most individuals; used when an RDA cannot be determined. 
UL,Tolerable Upper Intake Level,The highest average daily nutrient intake level that does not cause any adverse symptoms of toxicity to almost all individuals in the general population. 
AMDR,Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Range,"The range of intakes of an energy source (percent of calories from each macronutrient) that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, yet provides adequate amounts of essential nutrients."
CDDR,Chronic Disease Risk Reduction,"To date (2019) this has only been developed for sodium. The sodium Chronic Disease Risk Reduction Intake (CDRR) is the lowest level of
intake for which there was sufficient strength of evidence to characterize a chronic disease risk reduction. The concept of a range is embedded in the expression of the sodium CDRR in that for intakes above the CDDR, reduction in sodium intake is expected to reduce chronic disease risk."
